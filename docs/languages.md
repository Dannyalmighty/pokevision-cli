# Languages

The tool does not have full internationalisation support, however you can change the language of the Pok√©mon names which are displayed.

The CLI will try to automatically set the language for you, but if you need to override it, simply pass the language to the `--locale` flag.

The following locales are supported:
- en
- de
- fr
- ja
- pt_br
- ru
- zh_cn
- zh_hk

Example:

```sh
pokevision watch \
  --lat=40.712774 \
  --lon=-74.013408 \
  --name="World Trade Center" \
  --locale=de
```
